# Asset Catalog

Dagster lets you track the interactions between solids, outputs, and assets and view them in the Asset Catalog.

| <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> | Dagster event indicating that a solid has materialized an asset. |
| <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetKey" />             | A unique identifier for a particular external asset              |

## Overview

The Asset Catalog is an interface inside [Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit) that centers on assets. Each entry
in the catalog is an asset and includes:

- Runs that mutated or created the asset.
- Metadata logged by developers about the asset.

When an <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> is emitted during a pipeline run, this will surface relevant information into the Asset Catalog. You can about how to create these events in the [Asset Docs](/concepts/assets/asset-materializations).

## Asset Catalog in Dagit

After emitting an <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> event, we should see an entry in the Asset Catalog.

Note: The Asset Catalog in Dagit is only enabled for instances configured with an "asset-aware"
event log storage, such as `PostgresEventLogStorage` and `ConsolidatedSqliteEventLogStorage`. Here
is an example of an asset-aware instance configuration:

```yaml file=/concepts/assets/dagster.yaml
run_launcher:
  module: dagster.core.launcher
  class: DefaultRunLauncher

event_log_storage:
  module: dagster.core.storage.event_log
  class: ConsolidatedSqliteEventLogStorage
  config:
    base_dir: "/var/shared/dagster_home"
```

_Please refer to the [Dagster Instance](/deployment/dagster-instance) section for more information_
_about configuring your Dagster instance._

Once the Dagster instance is configured with an asset-aware event log storage, after you run a
pipeline which generates an asset, you'll find the asset listed on the `Assets` tab in Dagit.

You can also find the details about it by clicking the asset key of it, `my_dataset` in this case.

Clicking the \[View Asset Dashboard] on the materialization event from the log generated above can
also bring you to the corresponding Asset details page.
