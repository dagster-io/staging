# Installing Dagster

Welcome to the Dagster tutorial! Before we get started, we need to install Dagster on our machine.

## Python and pip

We’ll assume that you have some familiarity with Python, but you should be able to follow along even
if you’re coming from a different programming language. To check that Python and the pip package
manager are already installed in your environment or install them, you can follow the instructions
[here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

## Dagster and Dagit

```bash
pip install dagster dagit
```

This installs two modules:

- **Dagster**: the core programming model and abstraction stack; stateless, single-node,
  single-process and multi-process execution engines; and a CLI tool for driving those engines.
- **Dagit**: the UI for developing and operating Dagster pipelines, including a DAG browser, a
  type-aware config editor, and a live execution interface.

## If You Get Stuck

If you have questions on getting started, we'd love to hear from you:
