# Get a List of Pipeline Runs

<ExampleReferenceLink filePath="examples/filter_pipeline_runs" />

This example demonstrates how to get a list of pipeline runs based on the pipeline run status.

## Filter pipeline runs by statuses

The `get_pipeline_runs` function takes two parameters, instance and status_list.
You import `DagsterInstance` and pass `DagsterInstance.get()` to the instance parameter to
grab the current [DagsterInstance](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/instances/dagster-instance#mains).
For testing purpose, you can use `DagsterInstance.local_temp()`.

Then, use the `get_runs` attribute of the DagsterInstance, import `PipelineRunsFilter` and `PipelineRunStatus`,
and create a list of the pipeline run statuses you want to get. This example only asks the `get_runs` to filter by the `SUCCESS` status.
You can also filter by `FAILURE`, `QUEUED`, `STARTED`, etc. Pass the list of the statuses to the `status_list` parameter like below.

Each run you get contains a lot of information for your pipelines besides the pipeline name and
run id as shown below. You can also get its run config, mode, working directory, repository location, etc.

```python literalinclude caption=get_pipeline_runs.py
file:/filter_pipeline_runs/filter_pipeline_runs/get_pipeline_runs.py
startAfter:start_run_marker_0
endBefore:end_run_marker_0
```
