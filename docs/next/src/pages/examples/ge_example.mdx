# Great Expectations integration

<ExampleReferenceLink filePath="examples/ge_example" />

This example demonstrates how to use the GE solid factory
to test incoming data against a set of expectations built through Great Expectations' tooling.

For this example, we'll be using two versions of a dataset of baseball team payroll and wins,
with one version modified to hold incorrect data.


The basic call to the GE solid factory is below.


```python literalinclude caption=ge_demo.py
file:/ge_example/ge_demo.py
lines:25-27
```

And here's how you could use that call with other solids

```python literalinclude caption=ge_demo.py
file:/ge_example/ge_demo.py
lines:18-23
```

(alternatively, one could use hooks
to respond to the expectation result [INSERT HOOK TUTORIAL HERE])

Finally, here's the full pipeline using the GE solid, with presets to use both the
correct and incorrect data:

```python literalinclude caption=ge_demo.py
file:/ge_example/ge_demo.py
lines:1-77
```
