# Ad-hoc Execution

We provide several different ways to do one-off execution of pipelines and solids. For recurring execution, consult the /overview/scheduling-partitions/schedules section.

## Dagit

The Dagit [playground](/overview/dagit#playground) offers a way interactively build up the configuration for a run of a pipeline. Drops downs are available for selecting any defined <PyObject module="dagster" object="PresetDefinition" displayText='Presets' /> or [partitions](/overview/scheduling-partitions/partitions)

## CLI

The `dagster` [cli](/_apidocs/cli) includes both `dagster pipeline execute` for direct execution as well as `dagster pipeline launch` for async launching.

## Python APIs

We also provide python APIs for execution that are useful when writing tests or scripts. <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline" /> for full full pipeline execution and <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_solid" /> for testing an individual solid.

By default the python APIs will use an ephemeral <PyObject module="dagster" object="DagsterInstance" /> to avoid reporting test runs to the instance. When using the python API for production runs, set the instance using `instance=DagsterInstance.get()` to use the default loading behavior for the instance.

If pipeline execution will involve reconstucting the pipeline in another process, such as when using the multi-process executor or dagstermill, the python APIs will need a <PyObject module="dagster" object="reconstructable" /> instance of the pipeline. This work is handled for you when using dagit or the cli.
