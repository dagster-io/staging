# Object Managers

Dagster solids have [inputs and outputs](/overview/solids-pipelines/solids#solid-inputs-and-outputs).  When a solid produces an output, where and how is it stored?  When it's time to pass an object to a solid's input, how is that object loaded?  <PyObject module="dagster" object="ObjectManager" />s, <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputManager" />s, and <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputManager" />s let the developer decide.

## Object managers

<PyObject module="dagster" object="ObjectManager" />s are user-provided objects that know how to load solid inputs and handle solid outputs.  For example, an ObjectManager might store and retrieve solid outputs and inputs from files on a filesystem.  Each solid output can have its own ObjectManager, or multiple solid outputs can share an ObjectManager.  The ObjectManager that’s used for handling a particular solid output is automatically used for loading it in subsequent solids.

I.e. an ObjectManager handles the teal boxes:

</p>

The default ObjectManager, <PyObject module="dagster" object="mem_object_manager" />, stores outputs in memory, but this only works for the single process executor.  Dagster provides out-of-the-box ObjectManagers that pickle objects and save them to a local filesystem, Amazon S3, Azure ADLS, or GCS.

ObjectManagers are [resources](/overview/modes-resources-presets/modes-resources), which means users can supply different ObjectManagers for the same solid outputs in different situations.  For example, you might use an in-memory ObjectManager for unit-testing a pipeline and an S3 ObjectManager in production.

## Input managers and output managers

<PyObject module="dagster" object="InputManager" />s are for situations where you need to control how inputs are loaded independently of how outputs are stored.  They're useful for controlling the inputs at the beginning of a pipeline, as well as for situations where you don't have control over the manager used for an upstream output.

<PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputManager" />s are for situations where you need to control how outputs are handled independently of how inputs are loaded.  They're useful for controlling the outputs at the end of a pipeline.

## Setting a pipeline-wide object manager

By default, all the outputs in a pipeline use the same ObjectManager.  This ObjectManager is determined by the <PyObject module="dagster" object="ResourceDefinition" /> provided for the `"object_manager"` resource key.  `"object_manager"` is a resource key that Dagster reserves specifically for this purpose.

Here’s how to specify that all solid outputs are stored using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="fs_object_manager" />, which pickles outputs and stores them on the local filesystem.  It stores files in a directory with the run ID in the path, so that outputs from prior runs will never be overwritten.

```python literalinclude caption=default_object_manager.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/object_managers/default_object_manager.py
```

## Providing a custom object manager

If you have specific requirements for where and how your outputs should be stored and retrieved, you can define your own ObjectManager.  For example, if your solids output Pandas DataFrames to populate tables in a data warehouse, you might write the following:

```python literalinclude caption=custom_object_manager.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/object_managers/custom_object_manager.py
startAfter:start_marker
endBefore:end_marker
```

The provided `context` argument for `handle_output` is an <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputContext" />.  The provided `context` argument for `load_input` is an <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputContext" />.  The linked API documentation lists all the fields that are available on these objects.

## Selecting an object manager per output

Not all the outputs in a pipeline should necessarily be stored the same way.  Maybe some of the outputs are Pandas DataFrames that should live in tables, and others are random Python objects that should be pickled on the filesystem.

To select the ObjectManager for a particular output, you can set an `manager_key` on the <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputDefinition" />, and then refer to that `manager_key` when setting object managers in your <PyObject module="dagster" object="ModeDefinition" />.  In this example, the output of solid1 will go to `my_object_manager` and the output of solid2 will go to `fs_object_manager`.

```python literalinclude caption=object_manager_per_output.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/object_managers/object_manager_per_output.py
startAfter:start_marker
endBefore:end_marker
```

## Providing per-output metadata to the object manager

You might want to provide static metadata that controls how particular outputs are stored.

For example, if your pipeline produces DataFrames to populate tables in a data warehouse, you might want to specify the table that each output goes to.  To accomplish this, you can define `metadata` on each <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputDefinition" />:

```python literalinclude caption=metadata.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/object_managers/metadata.py
startAfter:solids_start_marker
endBefore:solids_end_marker
```

The ObjectManager can then access this metadata when storing or retrieving data, via the <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputContext" />.

```python literalinclude caption=metadata.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/object_managers/metadata.py
startAfter:asset_store_start_marker
endBefore:asset_store_end_marker
```

## Providing per-output config to the object manager

When launching a run, you might want to parameterize how particular outputs are stored.

For example, if your pipeline produces DataFrames to populate tables in a data warehouse, you might want to specify the table that each output goes to at run launch time.

To accomplish this, you can define an `output_config_schema` on the object manager definition. The ObjectManager methods can access this config when storing or loading data, via the <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputContext" />.

```python literalinclude caption=output_config.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/object_managers/output_config.py
startAfter:object_manager_start_marker
endBefore:object_manager_end_marker
```

Then, when executing a pipeline, you can pass in this per-output config.

```python literalinclude caption=output_config.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/object_managers/output_config.py
startAfter:execute_start_marker
endBefore:execute_end_marker
```
