## What is dbt?

[dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) (data build tool) helps engineers transform
data in their warehouses by simply writing `SELECT` statements. dbt automatically builds a
dependency graph for your transformations and turns these `SELECT` statements into tables and views
in your data warehouse.

dbt not only runs your data transformations, but also can create data quality tests and generate
documentation for your data, right out of the box. To learn more about dbt, visit
[the official dbt documentation website](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction).

Dagster orchestrates dbt alongside _other technologies_, so you can combine dbt with Spark, Python,
etc. in a single pipeline. Dagster also provides built-in operational and data observability
capabilities, like storing dbt run results longitudinally and sending alerts when a dbt run fails.

`dagster-dbt` is an integration library that provides pre-built solids and resources for using dbt
together with Dagster. The solids in the library are designed to be configurable for any dbt
project.

## Running dbt in a Dagster pipeline

### dbt CLI

`dagster-dbt` provides solids for running commands through the
[dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/cli-overview).
To run the dbt CLI, your dbt project directory must be on your local filesystem and you must have
a dbt profile already set up to connect to your data warehouse. Visit
[the official dbt CLI documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/cli-overview) for more details.

To check that your dbt project is setup properly, run the following shell command:

```bash
...
```
